# The gaming room software design document outlines the benefits and drawbacks of various operating systems for hosting a web server. Having experience primarily with Linux and Windows, I was knowledgeable about the pros and cons of each in terms of cost, complexity, and requirements. While coding the application, the document provided clear requirements that needed to be met to satisfy the customer’s needs. Designing the UML diagram also helped structure the application, showing how the framework would work with Java code.

The rest of the document includes recommendations for various operating systems and their specific requirements. Development requirements could also be improved for each operating system, as user needs change, such as adding compatibility for platforms like PlayStation and Xbox. Users also request specific updates to the code, and updating the documentation is essential for future changes. Their needs vary from rendering images to adding chat features for players.

Coding in Maven with a built-in Apache server was a new experience for me. In the future, I’ll have a better understanding of how the packages work together in relation to classes and instances. Learning the Maven framework involved a lot of research since the number of dependencies can be overwhelming. Moving forward, working with Maven will always require careful research into which API version is needed and the specific changes required for each project.
